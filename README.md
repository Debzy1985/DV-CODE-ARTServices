##  About The Developer

**Adebowale Samuel Lipede**  
*Founder & Technical Architect*

This platform is the central technical artifact of my application. I single-handedly designed, architected, and built this full-stack system to prove:

1.  **Technical Mastery:** Ability to deliver a production-ready, scalable platform using modern best practices.
2.  **Market Insight:** Deep understanding of a pressing need in the UK's transport infrastructure, especially with the EV transition.
3.  **Entrepreneurial Execution:** From concept to working prototype, demonstrating the capacity to lead a tech venture in the UK.

Every technical decision from choosing TypeScript for robustness to Supabase for real-time scalability was made with the UK market launch in mind. This repository is a testament to my technical promise and commitment to contributing to the UK's tech ecosystem.
